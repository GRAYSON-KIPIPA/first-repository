Upon completion of this session, you will be able to
- Add dynamic contents to the web page
- Understand concept of server side rendering
- Get famililar with view engines, specifically ejs


1. Here is the first task to get basic understanding of rendering dynamic content.
    - Create a new page with two buttons and a `<p>` tag
    - Name buttons as increment and decrement
    - The page should be available when user visits `localhost:3000/dynamic`
    - The `<p>` element should initially display `0`
    - When user clicks the increment button, the content of `<p>` element shold `increment`
    - when user clicks the decrement button, the content of `<p>` element should `decrement`


2. To understand server side rendering, use [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXEesONd_54&t=1818s) 


3. Redo the 26may assignment with the help of concept obtained in `2` above, `(server side rendering)`
